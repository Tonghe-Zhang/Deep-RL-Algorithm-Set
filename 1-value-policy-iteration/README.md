# Homework 1

This assignment consists of two tasks. The detailed requirements of each task can be found in `hw1.pdf`.

Please fill in the blanks inside the "YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE" comments, any changes outside the area might be **ignored**.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Submitting the Results
After finishing your homework, please remember to commit the changes and push them to the GitHub repo.

TAs have created an GitHub workflow to evaluate your code automatically, and a reference score of your homework can be found in the Actions page of your repository. (The total points of this homework is 100.)

## NOTICE: DO NOT MODIFY AUTO-GRADING CODE!
The auto-grading relies on the contents within the `.github`, `test` folders, and the `test_main.py` file. These files should not be altered. You will not be able to modify your commit history as all changes are saved permanently in the GitHub classroom records.

Attempts to bypass the auto-grading system, either by altering grading scripts or creating functions intended to manipulate the test cases, will be recorded. Teaching assistants can easily verify any changes to these files.

Modifying auto-grading code or attempting to manipulate it will result in a zero mark for the assignment.
