# Deep-RL-Algorithm-Set
Implementation of foundational and state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms. 
Extended from graduate course ''Deep Reinforcement Learning'' from Tsinghua University. Credit to lecturer: Huazhe Xu.

Algorithms include:

* Value Iteration, Policy Iteration
* DQN with N-step replay buffer, Double DQN, Dueling DQN, Prioritized Experience Replay
* DDPG, TD3, SAC
* Clipped PPO
* Offline RL algorithms, in particular EDAC.
